# Rainyy Ink

This is my first full website project built for my art and tattoo designs.  
I made this to show my work, including original pieces, custom request options, and ways for people to contact me.  
Everything was designed and coded by me using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

---

## Overview

Rainyy Ink is a responsive website that includes:
- A home page that introduces my work  
- A gallery page showing finished tattoo and art designs  
- A custom page where people can request new designs  
- A contact page for anyone who wants to purchase a piece  

This project was built to practice front-end development skills while keeping the layout simple and easy to use.
